Imsanity will use the language that is configured for WordPress in wp-config.php

To create a translation for Imsanity you may want to use an app such as POEdit
http://sourceforge.net/projects/poedit/

In POEdit go to File -> New Catalog from POT file and select imsanity-xx_XX.pot.
After translating POEdit will generate a .po and .mo file.  Be sure to
save it in the format imsanity-xx_XX (where xx is the language code used by WordPress)
